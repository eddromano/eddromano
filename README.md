- 👋 Hi, I’m Eduardo, @eddromano

- 👀 I've started learning coding and algorithms a long time ago when I was going to college to get my Masters of Science in Electrical Engineering.
I used to work as a web developer and after I graduated I had to dedicate my time on other matters. Now, years later, I'm back to coding and I want
to refresh my knowledge and get updated so I can work fulltime with what I love. Coding and software development.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science or the CS50 program offered by Harvard University.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on finding solutions and to get help when problems or questions arise.

- 📫 You can reach me at ohlssons@gmail.com. Use subject "to Eduardo - about CS50"
