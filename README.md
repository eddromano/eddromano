- 👋 Hi, I’m Eduardo, @eddromano

- 👀  I've started learning coding and algorithms a long time ago when I was 
creating projects with Macromedia Flash (at the time) and got into ActionScript to make more complex animations. A few years later, I started my major in Electrical Engineering, where I learned Assembly, C, and Pascal. I also got into web development and took some Java courses, but unfortunately, I did not code for many years because of my jobs. But, I recently realized that I put aside something that I always loved and felt excited about, so I decided to start coding again. So here I am, taking CS50x from Harvard University to begin. Wish me good luck.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science or the CS50 program offered by Harvard University.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on finding solutions and to get help when problems or questions arise.
